Changes I wanna make:
	
Entity.h:
	-Remove the EntityManager reference from this class it should not know about the manager, only the other way around. 
	 So whenever adding a new Entity, its gonna look like EntityManager.addEntity(std::string name);

	-Maybe make animations a component instead of a member variable of the sprite component? In the way that we can call 
	 Entity.AddComponent<Animation>()?
	
	-Replace std::string to const char* where possible

EntityManager.cpp
	-On Render() make a way of fetching the entity by the layer number instead of callig a method every time


-Add tags to entities class
-Make it so collisions between 2 non-trigger box colliders prevent the objects from overlapping

-Add Debug and color to text
